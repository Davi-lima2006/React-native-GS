# npm resolution error report

While resolving: gs-mobile@1.0.0
Found: react-native@0.79.2
node_modules/react-native
  react-native@"0.79.2" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react-native@"^0.10.1" from react-native-masked-view@0.2.0
node_modules/react-native-masked-view
  react-native-masked-view@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
